# Dice

Dice plugin for errbot, which allows rolling dice through a command. This uses the [python-dice](https://github.com/borntyping/python-dice) library for dice parsing, and thus follows the same syntax supported by the underlying library.

# Installation

Errbot can install this repository using `!repos install https://github.com/jasedit/errbot-dice`.

# Usage

Once installed, the dice rolling responds to the roll command:
```
!roll 1d6
```
